Due to the upstream release of a stable build for [Duplicati v2](https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati/releases/tag/v2.1.0.4_stable_2025-01-31) we will be updating [our image](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-duplicati/) tags to accommodate the change.

For future builds, the `latest` tag will track stable releases of Duplicati, while the `development` tag will track beta releases. We will no longer be building canary releases, unless there is sufficient demand to justify doing so.
