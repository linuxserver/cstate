Most images using our alpine-nginx base image are being updated to alpine 3.15 with php8 and some significant changes to the nginx configs.

Changes you will likely notice:

- Bring our default shipped configs as close as possible to alpine upstream defaults
  - <https://git.alpinelinux.org/aports/tree/main/nginx/nginx.conf?h=3.15-stable>
- Include `worker_processes.conf` and init script to generate it in the base
- Include `resolver.conf` and init script to generate it in the base
- Include `ssl.conf` in the base (the same as what is currently shipped in SWAG, but adjusted to use the self-signed certs generated by the base)
- `include /config/nginx/site-confs/*.conf;` with `*.conf` extension (rename existing user files automatically)
- Rework `default.conf`
  - Expect applications inside containers to exist at `/app/www/public/`, and if that does not exist, use `/config/www`
  - Include ipv6 support
  - deny access to `.htaccess`/`.htpasswd` files
  - adjust php location and `fastcgi_params` to use `PATH_INFO` and mitigate `HTTP_PROXY` vulnerability
- Restructure nginx configs
  - Configs in `/defaults/nginx/` are recursively copied to the user's `/config/nginx/` (maintaining the structure)
  - All configs are now named `*.sample` and all include `## Version YYYY/MM/DD - Changelog: <url to repo history>` used by `/etc/cont-init.d/85-version-checks`
    - Required configs (`/config/nginx/nginx.conf`, `/config/nginx/server-confs/ssl.conf` and `/config/nginx/site-confs/default.conf`) are enabled by default. Downstream images can include and/or enable others as needed (ex: SWAG will enable `/config/nginx/location-confs/proxy.conf` and `/config/nginx/server-confs/502.conf`)
  - Folder structure is as follows (in the `/config/nginx/` context):
    - All nginx based images:
      - Includes `nginx.conf` (enabled by default)
      - Includes `resolver.conf` (enabled by default)
      - Includes `ssl.conf` (enabled by default)
      - Includes `worker_processes.conf` (enabled by default)
      - `/config/nginx/site-confs/*` included inside the `http` context in `/config/nginx/nginx.conf`
        - Includes `default.conf` (enabled by default)
    - SWAG:
      - Includes `502.conf` (enabled by default)
      - Includes `authelia-location.conf`
      - Includes `authelia-server.conf`
      - Includes `ldap-location.conf`
      - Includes `ldap-server.conf`
      - Includes `proxy.conf` (enabled by default)

Under the hood:

- Split out init scripts
  - `root/migrations/01-nginx-site-confs-default` migrate existing `default` to `default.conf`
  - `root/etc/cont-init.d/11-folders` creates all the folders needed in `/config`
  - `root/etc/cont-init.d/12-samples` removes existing `*.sample` files from `/config/nginx` and copies any included `*.sample` files from the image
  - `root/etc/cont-init.d/13-nginx` enable required configs (`nginx.conf`, `ssl.conf` and `default.conf`) if they don't exist, setup `dhparams.pem`, setup `resolver.conf`, setup `worker_processes.conf`
  - `root/etc/cont-init.d/14-php` configure php
  - `root/etc/cont-init.d/15-keygen` create self signed certificates for `ssl.conf`
  - `root/etc/cont-init.d/20-permissions` set `/config` permissions
  - `root/etc/cont-init.d/85-version-checks` check all enabled `*.conf` files against all `*.sample` files shipped with the image and alert the user about updates
