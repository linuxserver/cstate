We have released a new container for [Yaak](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-yaak/)!

[Yaak](https://yaak.app/) is a desktop API client for organizing and executing REST, GraphQL, and gRPC requests. It's built using [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [ReactJS](https://react.dev/).
