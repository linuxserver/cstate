We have decided to retire our discourse forums due to minimal use, administrative overhead, and other various reasons.

Moving forward, we will leverage GitHub discussions which have already gone live and can be reached here [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/linuxserver/discussions). Our primary support method remains Discord, but you are welcome to use Discussions. Image requests will ONLY be accepted on Discussions.

*Note: no threads will be migrated over, if you have an open thread, please recreate it on Discussions.*


If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please visit us on [discord](https://discord.gg/HgvsypQr) in #lounge.
