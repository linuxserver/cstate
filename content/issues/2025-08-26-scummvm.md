We have released a new container for [ScummVM](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-scummvm)!

[ScummVM](https://www.scummvm.org/) is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical adventure and role-playing games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed! ScummVM is a complete rewrite of these games executables and is not an emulator.
