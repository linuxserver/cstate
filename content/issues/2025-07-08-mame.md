We have released a new container for [MAME](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mame)!

[MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/) is a free and open-source emulator designed to emulate the hardware of arcade games, video game consoles, old computers and other systems in software on modern personal computers.
