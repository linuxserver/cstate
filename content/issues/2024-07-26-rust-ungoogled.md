[RustDesk](https://rustdesk.com/) is a full-featured open source remote control alternative for self-hosting and security with minimal configuration.

[Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-ungoogled-chromium)

[Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium) is Google Chromium, sans dependency on Google web services.
