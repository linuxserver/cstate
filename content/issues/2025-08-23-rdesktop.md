Following the release of our Selkies-based [Webtop](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-webtop) images, we have decided to begin a phased deprecation of our [rdesktop](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-rdesktop) images. Due to substantial overhead in maintaining so many rdesktop-specific images, and with webtop now covering *most* use cases, this process will start with the removal of all non-Ubuntu image versions on 2025-09-30. If you are currently using a non-Ubuntu version of rdesktop we recommend migrating to one of the Ubuntu tags before this date.

Beyond this, we will reassess the usage of the remaining image versions and make a decision as to the viability of the rdesktop platform. Once a decision has been made we will publish information about the process and timescales involved.
