Due to the upstream project being purchased by a commercial entity and stopping development, we have decided to deprecate our [Snapdrop](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-snapdrop) image. Consider switching to our [Pairdrop](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-pairdrop) image for similar functionality.
