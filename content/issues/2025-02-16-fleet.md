Due to issues maintaining the necessary level of development, we will be deprecating our [Fleet container](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-fleet) and [Fleet application](https://github.com/linuxserver/fleet) on June 1st, 2025.

The [new API](https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/introducing-linuxserver-api) and [images page](https://www.linuxserver.io/our-images) will serve as a replacement for our Fleet instance.
