{"is":"issue","title":"rdesktop Phased Deprecation Notice","body":"\u003cp\u003eFollowing the release of our Selkies-based \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-webtop\"\u003eWebtop\u003c/a\u003e images, we have decided to begin a phased deprecation of our \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-rdesktop\"\u003erdesktop\u003c/a\u003e images. Due to substantial overhead in maintaining so many rdesktop-specific images, and with webtop now covering \u003cem\u003emost\u003c/em\u003e use cases, this process will start with the removal of all non-Ubuntu image versions on 2025-09-30. If you are currently using a non-Ubuntu version of rdesktop we recommend migrating to one of the Ubuntu tags before this date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond this, we will reassess the usage of the remaining image versions and make a decision as to the viability of the rdesktop platform. Once a decision has been made we will publish information about the process and timescales involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n","createdAt":"2025-08-23 23:00:00 +0000 UTC","lastMod":"2025-08-23 16:10:52 +0100 +0100","permalink":"https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2025-08-23-rdesktop/","severity":"<no value>","resolved":false,"informational":true,"resolvedAt":"<no value>","affected":["Deprecations","rdesktop"],"filename":"2025-08-23-rdesktop.md"}
