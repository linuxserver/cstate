For this reason we strongly recommend you do not make this application public facing and if you must do so other layers of security and SSL should be considered an absolute bare minimum requirement.  We see this proxy being used primarily on a LAN so that all the users NNTP applications can share a common set of internal credentials allowing for central managment of the upstream account e.g change provider, server, thread limits for all applications with one global config change.\u003c/p\u003e\n","createdAt":"2018-05-15 00:00:00 +0000 UTC","lastMod":"2021-07-03 00:52:41 +0200 +0200","permalink":"https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2018-05-15-nntp2nntp/","severity":"<no value>","resolved":false,"informational":true,"resolvedAt":"<no value>","affected":["New Containers","nntp2nntp"],"filename":"2018-05-15-nntp2nntp.md"}
