It brings together citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers. Insights from this data are helping scientists to better understand biology, and providing new opportunities for developing therapeutics.\u003c/p\u003e\n","createdAt":"2020-03-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC","lastMod":"2021-07-03 00:52:41 +0200 +0200","permalink":"https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2020-03-20-foldingathome/","severity":"<no value>","resolved":false,"informational":true,"resolvedAt":"<no value>","affected":["New Containers","foldingathome"],"filename":"2020-03-20-foldingathome.md"}
