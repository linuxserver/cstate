Creating a new container from scratch does not exhibit this behaviour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis non-standard behaviour causes containers to fail to start correctly in some cases, and may result in unexpected or unwanted configuration in others. For example, in our \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-sabnzbd/issues/188\"\u003eSABnzbd image\u003c/a\u003e the \u003ccode\u003ePATH\u003c/code\u003e environment variable is overwritten, leaving the application unable to locate the necessary Python modules to enable it to start. This is likely to become more common in the future, and there is not a practical or scalable solution that we can apply from our end to avoid this issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur position remains that we provide support only for containers created and updated using Docker Compose, the Docker CLI, or using our Unraid templates, and not any 3rd party tools.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","createdAt":"2023-05-22 12:00:00 +0000 UTC","lastMod":"2023-11-22 14:28:25 +0000 UTC","permalink":"https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2023-05-22-portainer/","severity":"notice","resolved":true,"informational":false,"resolvedAt":"2023-11-22 18:00:00Z","affected":["Known Issues","portainer","synology"],"filename":"2023-05-22-portainer.md"}
