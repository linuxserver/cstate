Update - 2024-03-30 Further analysis of the exploit code indicates that it is only functional on amd64 hardware running glibc and a deb or rpm-based Linux distribution. The original CISA alert stated that the exploit could allow remote code execution, however, it remains unclear exactly what the payload was intended to do and so they have changed their description to &amp;ldquo;may allow unauthorized access to affected systems&amp;rdquo;.</description><content type="html">&lt;h3 id="update---2024-04-10">Update - 2024-04-10&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>As best we can tell at this point, none of our images were or are impacted by this vulnerability, but our original recommendations remain in place.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="original-post">Original Post&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A supply chain compromise has been discovered in the XZ Utils data compression library, being tracked under &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/03/29/reported-supply-chain-compromise-affecting-xz-utils-data-compression-library-cve-2024-3094">CVE-2024-3094&lt;/a>, which could allow remote code execution under certain circumstances. The original report is available &lt;a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4">here&lt;/a> if you are interested in the technical details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have evaluated all of our current base images for indications that they may be vulnerable to this exploit:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Our Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora base images are using older versions of XZ Utils which do not appear to contain the vulnerable code.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our Arch base image did contain an affected version of XZ Utils, and we have now pushed an updated build that includes a fixed version of the XZ package.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our Alpine Edge base image did contain an affected version of XZ Utils, but did not appear to be vulnerable due to the exploit&amp;rsquo;s dependency on glibc, and we have now pushed an updated build that includes a fixed version of the XZ package.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our other Alpine base images are using older versions of XZ Utils which do not appear to contain the vulnerable code.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So far the only exploitation path that has been observed is via SSH, and so in the vast majority of cases could not be exploited in any of our container environments, but we always recommend that you ensure any internet-facing containers are properly secured and kept up to date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will update this post as and when more information becomes available.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>endlessh Deprecation Notice</title><link>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2024-03-21-endlessh/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2024-03-21-endlessh/</guid><category/><description>Due to a lack of upstream development, we have decided to deprecate our endlessh container.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>Due to a lack of upstream development, we have decided to deprecate our &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-endlessh">endlessh&lt;/a> container.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Dillinger Deprecation Notice</title><link>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2024-03-20-dillinger/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2024-03-20-dillinger/</guid><category/><description>Due to a lack of upstream development, we have decided to deprecate our dillinger container.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>Due to a lack of upstream development, we have decided to deprecate our &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-dillinger">dillinger&lt;/a> container.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>New Container: Speedtest Tracker</title><link>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2024-02-10-speedtest-tracker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2024 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2024-02-10-speedtest-tracker/</guid><category/><description>We have released a new container for Speedtest Tracker!

&lt;p>The Alpine maintainers have backported a fixed version of the affected library to 3.19 and we have published a new version of our 3.19 base image that should resolve the issues with 3.x kernels. It will take a few days for all affected downstream images to push new builds, but any image released from this point onwards will include the fix.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="original-post">Original Post&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is a known issue with the version of curl currently shipped with Alpine 3.19 and 3.x kernels, causing an endless loop to hang containers, usually on startup. The 3.x kernel line has been End of Life since 2017, but some prebuilt systems such as older Synology NAS units are still running it. At time of posting, around 10% of our images have already been rebased to Alpine 3.19 and are therefore affected by this issue, and this number will continue to rise over the next few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While a fix has been applied to the affected upstream library we do not have an ETA for if or when it will find its way into the version of curl shipped with Alpine 3.19.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="workaround">Workaround&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As a workaround you can revert to an older tag from before the image was rebased to Alpine 3.19, but please be aware that older tags do not receive updates. Refer to the Changelog in the Readme to see when the change was made for a given image. For Unraid users this will require you to edit the container and under the Advanced options change the Repository to append the required tag.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>New Container: Faster-Whisper</title><link>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2023-11-30-faster-whisper/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2023 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2023-11-30-faster-whisper/</guid><category/><description>We have released a new container for Faster-Whisper!

The readme has been updated to reflect how the password for new installs are handled going forward
There is a known issue with qBittorrent 4.6.1, due to an upstream change which changes the Web UI password to a random value on startup if you have not changed it from the default. This change has been made for security reasons due to hackers exploiting users who have exposed their instances to the internet with default credentials.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fix has been released, update to 4.6.2. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-qbittorrent#application-setup">readme&lt;/a> has been updated to reflect how the password for new installs are handled going forward&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a known issue with qBittorrent 4.6.1, due to an &lt;a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/news#mon-nov-20th-2023---qbittorrent-v4.6.1-release">upstream change&lt;/a> which changes the Web UI password to a random value on startup if you have not changed it from the default.

&lt;p>Due to an &lt;a href="https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/19984">upstream bug&lt;/a> the generated password is not printed to the container logs, making it impossible to log in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="workaround">Workaround&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As a workaround until a fix can be released, start the container with the &lt;code>:version-4.6.0-r0&lt;/code> image tag, login to the Web UI using the old default credentials, and change the admin account password. You will then be able to switch back to the &lt;code>:version-4.6.1-r0&lt;/code> or &lt;code>:latest&lt;/code> tags. For Unraid users this will require you to edit the container and under the Advanced options change the Repository to append the required tag; you can find step-by-step instructions &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-qbittorrent/issues/268#issuecomment-1821123416">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Unifi Controller Deprecation Reminder</title><link>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2023-11-12-unifi-controller/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Nov 2023 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2023-11-12-unifi-controller/</guid><category/><description>As we previously announced, due to the way in which Ubiquiti package and distribute their software our Unifi Controller container has reached a point where we cannot upgrade to newer supported packages without making breaking changes to the image.

Installations for existing users will be migrated automatically when updating the container image. All future updates to your Nextcloud instance will happen via container image updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Updating via the admin web UI is no longer supported.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Downgrading is not supported.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An important thing to keep in mind is that systems that automatically update your container will result in irreversible changes to your Nextcloud instance. We recommend pinning a specific tagged version like &lt;code>lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud:version-27.0.0&lt;/code> and manually changing your image version when you are ready to upgrade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Excerpts from the updated README:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="updating-nextcloud">Updating Nextcloud&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Updating Nextcloud is done by pulling the new image, and recreating the container with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is only possible to upgrade one major version at a time. For example, if you want to upgrade from version 14 to 16, you will have to upgrade from version 14 to 15, then from 15 to 16.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since all data is stored in the &lt;code>/config&lt;/code> and &lt;code>/data&lt;/code> volumes, nothing gets lost. The startup script will check for the version in your volume and the installed docker version. If it finds a mismatch, it automatically starts the upgrade process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="cant-start-nextcloud">Can&amp;rsquo;t start Nextcloud&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If after updating your container image you receive a message along these lines:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Can&amp;rsquo;t start Nextcloud because the version of the data (&lt;code>#.#.#.#&lt;/code>) is more than one major version behind the docker image version (&lt;code>#.#.#.#&lt;/code>) and upgrading more than one major version is not supported. Please run an image tagged for the major version &lt;code>##&lt;/code> first.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The version of Nextcloud that you have installed in your persistent &lt;code>/config&lt;/code> volume will need to be updated using an older image before you can use the new image.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Check your &lt;code>/config/www/nextcloud/config/config.php&lt;/code> file or &lt;code>/config/www/nextcloud/version.php&lt;/code> file to determine the version you have installed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Switch your image to the corresponding major version from the table above (ex: your files indicate &lt;code>24.x.x&lt;/code>, use &lt;code>lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud:version-24.0.12&lt;/code>) and start the container&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>docker exec -it nextcloud updater.phar&lt;/code> &lt;strong>&lt;em>repeatedly&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> until you have updated to Nextcloud &lt;code>27.x.x&lt;/code>, or the updater says &lt;code>This version of Nextcloud is not compatible with &amp;gt; PHP x.x&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check your files again to determine the version you have installed
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If your installed version is below 26, repeat the steps above until you get to version 26&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If your installed version is 26 or 27, continue with the instructions below&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Switch your image to &lt;code>lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud:version-27.0.0&lt;/code> and start the container. Note the &lt;code>updater.phar&lt;/code> is no longer available, or needed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>docker logs nextcloud&lt;/code> and check for any issues (report &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-nextcloud/issues">issues on GitHub&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As of posting this information, Nextclouod 27 is the latest current version. If you are reading this after a new major version of Nextcloud beyond 27 is released, check &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-nextcloud/releases">releases on GitHub&lt;/a> and proceed to switch to the next major version tag one by one until you are current. Updating more than one major version at a time is not supported&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You should now be able to switch your image to &lt;code>lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud&lt;/code> (no tag) if you prefer to run the latest image (although we do recommend pinning a specific version)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>docker exec -it nextcloud mv /config/nginx/site-confs/default.conf /config/nginx/site-confs/default.conf.bak&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>docker exec -it nextcloud mv /config/nginx/nginx.conf /config/nginx/nginx.conf.bak&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>docker restart nextcloud&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nextcloud should now be in a working state&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Optional:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you had customized any of the nginx configs that were renamed above, compare the &lt;code>.bak&lt;/code> file to the new live file and apply any customizations you require. Note the &lt;code>root&lt;/code> line in &lt;code>site-confs/default.conf&lt;/code> should be changed from &lt;code>/config/www/nextcloud/&lt;/code> to &lt;code>/app/www/public&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove the &lt;code>.bak&lt;/code> files&lt;/li>

&lt;p>There is a known issue with Portainer and the Synology Docker UI when updating (or otherwise recreating) containers, which causes them to overwrite settings in the new image with values from the old container. Creating a new container from scratch does not exhibit this behaviour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This non-standard behaviour causes containers to fail to start correctly in some cases, and may result in unexpected or unwanted configuration in others. For example, in our &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-sabnzbd/issues/188">SABnzbd image&lt;/a> the &lt;code>PATH&lt;/code> environment variable is overwritten, leaving the application unable to locate the necessary Python modules to enable it to start. This is likely to become more common in the future, and there is not a practical or scalable solution that we can apply from our end to avoid this issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Our position remains that we provide support only for containers created and updated using Docker Compose, the Docker CLI, or using our Unraid templates, and not any 3rd party tools.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>New Container: hiSHtory-server</title><link>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2023-05-19-hishtory/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2023-05-19-hishtory/</guid><category/><description>We have released a new container for hiSHtory-server!

Currently we offer two tags: latest and alpine. The former uses our Ubuntu base image and contains all of the tools and dependencies required to compile the Wireguard kernel modules from scratch if your host kernel is too old to have it built-in. The latter uses our Alpine base image and does not contain the build tools and dependencies, which means it will only work on hosts that already have the Wireguard kernel modules installed and running.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>We will shortly be making changes to the tags available for our &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-wireguard">Wireguard&lt;/a> image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently we offer two tags: &lt;code>latest&lt;/code> and &lt;code>alpine&lt;/code>. The former uses our Ubuntu base image and contains all of the tools and dependencies required to compile the Wireguard kernel modules from scratch if your host kernel is too old to have it built-in. The latter uses our Alpine base image and does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> contain the build tools and dependencies, which means it will only work on hosts that already have the Wireguard kernel modules installed and running.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost all kernel builds since 5.6 come with Wireguard included, along with some older ones that have had it backported, which means that shipping an extra 800Mb of image by default to support those running old kernels is increasingly unnecessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, we&amp;rsquo;re going to switch our tags around to make the Alpine-based image the default.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re currently using the &lt;code>latest&lt;/code> tag you&amp;rsquo;ll soon automatically get switched to the Alpine-based build.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re currently using the &lt;code>alpine&lt;/code> tag you&amp;rsquo;ll need to switch to &lt;code>latest&lt;/code> to continue receiving updates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re still running an old kernel and need the build support, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to switch to the &lt;code>legacy&lt;/code> tag.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Over the next several months we will begin to migrate our downstream images to using the full v3 init process and at that point your mods will need to have a v3 component to work reliably. v2-only mods will run on v3 images for the forseeable future but we will not provide support for that configuration and you may run into timing issues.&lt;/p>

If you have queries regarding how to migrate your mods please ask them on our &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/YWrKVTn">Discord server&lt;/a> in the #dev-talk channel.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Notification: Issues Following Plex Data Breach</title><link>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2022-08-24-plex/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2022-08-24-plex/</guid><category/><description>If you have a Plex account (not via OIDC provider like Google/Facebook/Apple) you will have recieved an email from them notifying you of a recent data breach and advising you to reset your password and force a logout of all connected devices.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://git.alpinelinux.org/aports/tree/main/nginx/nginx.conf?h=3.15-stable">https://git.alpinelinux.org/aports/tree/main/nginx/nginx.conf?h=3.15-stable&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Include &lt;code>resolver.conf&lt;/code> and init script to generate it in the base&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Include &lt;code>ssl.conf&lt;/code> in the base (the same as what is currently shipped in SWAG, but adjusted to use the self-signed certs generated by the base)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Rework &lt;code>default.conf&lt;/code>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Expect applications inside containers to exist at &lt;code>/app/www/public/&lt;/code>, and if that does not exist, use &lt;code>/config/www&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Include ipv6 support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>deny access to &lt;code>.htaccess&lt;/code>/&lt;code>.htpasswd&lt;/code> files&lt;/li>
&lt;li>adjust php location and &lt;code>fastcgi_params&lt;/code> to use &lt;code>PATH_INFO&lt;/code> and mitigate &lt;code>HTTP_PROXY&lt;/code> vulnerability&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Restructure nginx configs
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Configs in &lt;code>/defaults/nginx/&lt;/code> are recursively copied to the user&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>/config/nginx/&lt;/code> (maintaining the structure)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All configs are now named &lt;code>*.sample&lt;/code> and all include &lt;code>## Version YYYY/MM/DD - Changelog: &amp;lt;url to repo history&amp;gt;&lt;/code> used by &lt;code>/etc/cont-init.d/85-version-checks&lt;/code>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Required configs (&lt;code>/config/nginx/nginx.conf&lt;/code>, &lt;code>/config/nginx/server-confs/ssl.conf&lt;/code> and &lt;code>/config/nginx/site-confs/default.conf&lt;/code>) are enabled by default. Downstream images can include and/or enable others as needed (ex: SWAG will enable &lt;code>/config/nginx/location-confs/proxy.conf&lt;/code> and &lt;code>/config/nginx/server-confs/502.conf&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Folder structure is as follows (in the &lt;code>/config/nginx/&lt;/code> context):
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All nginx based images:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Includes &lt;code>nginx.conf&lt;/code> (enabled by default)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Includes &lt;code>resolver.conf&lt;/code> (enabled by default)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Includes &lt;code>ssl.conf&lt;/code> (enabled by default)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Includes &lt;code>worker_processes.conf&lt;/code> (enabled by default)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>/config/nginx/site-confs/*&lt;/code> included inside the &lt;code>http&lt;/code> context in &lt;code>/config/nginx/nginx.conf&lt;/code>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Includes &lt;code>default.conf&lt;/code> (enabled by default)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SWAG:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Includes &lt;code>502.conf&lt;/code> (enabled by default)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Includes &lt;code>authelia-location.conf&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Includes &lt;code>authelia-server.conf&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Includes &lt;code>ldap-location.conf&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Includes &lt;code>ldap-server.conf&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Includes &lt;code>proxy.conf&lt;/code> (enabled by default)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Split out init scripts
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>root/migrations/01-nginx-site-confs-default&lt;/code> migrate existing &lt;code>default&lt;/code> to &lt;code>default.conf&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>root/etc/cont-init.d/11-folders&lt;/code> creates all the folders needed in &lt;code>/config&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>root/etc/cont-init.d/12-samples&lt;/code> removes existing &lt;code>*.sample&lt;/code> files from &lt;code>/config/nginx&lt;/code> and copies any included &lt;code>*.sample&lt;/code> files from the image&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>root/etc/cont-init.d/13-nginx&lt;/code> enable required configs (&lt;code>nginx.conf&lt;/code>, &lt;code>ssl.conf&lt;/code> and &lt;code>default.conf&lt;/code>) if they don&amp;rsquo;t exist, setup &lt;code>dhparams.pem&lt;/code>, setup &lt;code>resolver.conf&lt;/code>, setup &lt;code>worker_processes.conf&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>root/etc/cont-init.d/14-php&lt;/code> configure php&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>root/etc/cont-init.d/15-keygen&lt;/code> create self signed certificates for &lt;code>ssl.conf&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>root/etc/cont-init.d/20-permissions&lt;/code> set &lt;code>/config&lt;/code> permissions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>root/etc/cont-init.d/85-version-checks&lt;/code> check all enabled &lt;code>*.conf&lt;/code> files against all &lt;code>*.sample&lt;/code> files shipped with the image and alert the user about updates&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="why-taken-from-the-authors-site">Why? (taken from the author&amp;rsquo;s site)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my opinion Calibre is a marvelous tool but is too big and has too much
dependencies to be used for its content server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s the main reason why I coded this OPDS server. I needed a simple
tool to be installed on a small server (Seagate Dockstar in my case).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I initially thought of Calibre2OPDS but as it generate static file no
search was possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later I added an simple HTML catalog that should be usable on my Kobo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So COPS&amp;rsquo;s main advantages are :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No need for many dependencies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No need for a lot of CPU or RAM.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not much code.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search is available.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>With Dropbox / owncloud it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to have an up to date OPDS server.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It was fun to code.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you want to use the OPDS feed don&amp;rsquo;t forget to specify feed.php at the end of your URL.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>New Container: Muximux</title><link>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2016-02-22-muximux/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2016-02-22-muximux/</guid><category/><description>We have released a new container for Muximux!
