Specifically, they are updating their API domain root from \u003ccode\u003eporkbun.com\u003c/code\u003e to \u003ccode\u003eapi.porkbun.com\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are unsure which version of SWAG you are running, you can use \u003ccode\u003edocker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels \u0026quot;build_version\u0026quot; }}' swag\u003c/code\u003e to output the version of the running container.
