The original CISA alert stated that the exploit could allow remote code execution, however, it remains unclear exactly what the payload was intended to do and so they have changed their description to \u0026ldquo;may allow unauthorized access to affected systems\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs best we can tell at this point, none of our images were or are impacted by this vulnerability, but our original recommendations remain in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"original-post\"\u003eOriginal Post\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA supply chain compromise has been discovered in the XZ Utils data compression library, being tracked under \u003ca href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/03/29/reported-supply-chain-compromise-affecting-xz-utils-data-compression-library-cve-2024-3094\"\u003eCVE-2024-3094\u003c/a\u003e, which could allow remote code execution under certain circumstances.
