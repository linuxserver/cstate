{"is":"issue","title":"Unifi OS Server & Unifi Network Application","body":"\u003cp\u003eThere has been a lot of \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/orgs/linuxserver/discussions/94\"\u003ediscussion\u003c/a\u003e recently regarding the annoucement from Ubiquiti that they intend to deprecate their Unifi Network Application and replace it with Unifi OS Server. This has led to questions around the ongoing support for our existing \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-unifi-network-application\"\u003eUnifi Network Application\u003c/a\u003e image and the creation of a Unifi OS Server image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnifi OS Server is a Podman-based orchestration system, that runs half a dozen separate components providing different elements of the Unifi service for both their networking equipment and their NVR products. They do not directly publish the images used for these components, and while it is technically possible to containerise the platform by extracting the images from a running install it is not something we are currently considering due to the administrative overhead involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will support our Unifi Network Application image for as long as Ubiquiti continue to make the install packages available to download, after which we will move to deprecate it. If the situation around Unifi OS Server changes significantly, we will re-evalutate whether or not it makes sense for us to create and maintain an image for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n","createdAt":"2026-02-22 21:00:00 +0000 UTC","lastMod":"2026-02-22 14:55:15 +0000 UTC","permalink":"https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2026-02-22-unifi-network-application/","severity":"<no value>","resolved":false,"informational":true,"resolvedAt":"<no value>","affected":["Notifications","unifi-network-application"],"filename":"2026-02-22-unifi-network-application.md"}
