{"is":"issue","title":"Reminder: Wireguard Legacy Tag Deprecation","body":"\u003cp\u003eA little over a year ago we updated our default Wireguard image to no longer support building the Wireguard kernel modules and moved that functionality to the \u003ccode\u003elegacy\u003c/code\u003e tag. We did this on the basis that most users were running a kernel that already had built-in Wireguard support (5.6 or above in terms of official kernel releases) and this allowed us to reduce the size of the default image by 600Mb for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRevisiting the situation now we see that the vast majority of users are now either running a kernel with built-in Wireguard support \u003cem\u003eor\u003c/em\u003e a custom kernel, such as on a VPS or NAS, which we have never supported building for. As a result we have decided to deprecate the \u003ccode\u003elegacy\u003c/code\u003e tag from the end of 2024.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice this means there\u0026rsquo;s only one case where there will be a still-supported kernel version that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have built-in Wireguard support: 4.19, which goes EOL at the end of 2025. Our stats show a tiny handful of users that this applies to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are still running a 4.19 kernel, or are running any other EOL pre-5.6 kernel, and for whatever reason cannot upgrade then your only option will be to build the Wireguard kernel modules \u003cem\u003eon the host\u003c/em\u003e, which the default image (using the \u003ccode\u003elatest\u003c/code\u003e tag) will then be able to make use of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will provide additional reminders of this deprecation towards the end of the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n","createdAt":"2024-10-27 20:00:00 +0000 UTC","lastMod":"2024-10-27 16:04:24 +0000 UTC","permalink":"https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2024-10-27-wireguard/","severity":"<no value>","resolved":false,"informational":true,"resolvedAt":"<no value>","affected":["Deprecations","wireguard"],"filename":"2024-10-27-wireguard.md"}
