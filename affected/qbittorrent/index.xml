There is a known issue with qBittorrent 4.6.1, due to an upstream change which changes the Web UI password to a random value on startup if you have not changed it from the default. This change has been made for security reasons due to hackers exploiting users who have exposed their instances to the internet with default credentials.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fix has been released, update to 4.6.2. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-qbittorrent#application-setup">readme&lt;/a> has been updated to reflect how the password for new installs are handled going forward&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a known issue with qBittorrent 4.6.1, due to an &lt;a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/news#mon-nov-20th-2023---qbittorrent-v4.6.1-release">upstream change&lt;/a> which changes the Web UI password to a random value on startup if you have not changed it from the default. This change has been made for security reasons due to hackers exploiting users who have exposed their instances to the internet with default credentials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to an &lt;a href="https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/19984">upstream bug&lt;/a> the generated password is not printed to the container logs, making it impossible to log in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="workaround">Workaround&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As a workaround until a fix can be released, start the container with the &lt;code>:version-4.6.0-r0&lt;/code> image tag, login to the Web UI using the old default credentials, and change the admin account password. You will then be able to switch back to the &lt;code>:version-4.6.1-r0&lt;/code> or &lt;code>:latest&lt;/code> tags. For Unraid users this will require you to edit the container and under the Advanced options change the Repository to append the required tag; you can find step-by-step instructions &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-qbittorrent/issues/268#issuecomment-1821123416">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>qBittorrent change to Alpine</title><link>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2022-01-07-qbittorrent/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2022-01-07-qbittorrent/</guid><category/><description>Due to the upstream project dropping support for Ubuntu LTS (Focal) in their most recent release (v4.4.0) we have decided to switch our qBittorrent container to our Alpine baseimage.

&lt;p>If you need to stay on the existing Ubuntu-based image with v4.3.9 of qBittorrent you may pin your install to the &lt;code>version-14.3.9.99202110311443-7435-01519b5e7ubuntu20.04.1&lt;/code> tag. &lt;strong>Please be aware that this image will not receive any further updates.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This change should not affect most users, however, if you rely on custom scripts or 3rd party packages you may need to make changes to ensure they continue to function as before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally - if you make use of the &lt;code>qbt&lt;/code> CLI tool - as part of this change we have switched from using &lt;a href="https://github.com/fedarovich/qbittorrent-cli">https://github.com/fedarovich/qbittorrent-cli&lt;/a>, which does not provide Alpine-compatible binaries, to &lt;a href="https://github.com/ludviglundgren/qbittorrent-cli">https://github.com/ludviglundgren/qbittorrent-cli&lt;/a> which does. While these tools are very similar in function, the syntax differs between them.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>qBittorrent Unstable Deprecation Notice</title><link>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2022-01-06-qbittorrent/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2022-01-06-qbittorrent/</guid><category/><description>Due to a lack of upstream support for Ubuntu LTS (Focal), we have made the decision to deprecate our qBittorrent Unstable image.
