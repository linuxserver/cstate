The last supported tags for 32-bit ARM will be 3.0.8.1507-ls151 for the stable branch and develop-3.0.8.1540-ls294 for the develop branch.
If you are currently running the Sonarr image on a 32-bit ARM platform we recommend you look at alternative options such as upgrading to a 64-bit OS if your hardware supports it.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>Due to the lack of reliable support for Mono on 32-bit ARM, we will shortly be deprecating the 32-bit ARM (armhf) version of our &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-sonarr">Sonarr container&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
