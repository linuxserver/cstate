The following Linuxserver containers have been confirmed not to be affected by this vulnerability due to existing mitigations, upstream patches, or workarounds applied to the container images.
Please note this applies to the latest versions of the below images only. If you are running older versions they may still be vulnerable.

&lt;p>The following Linuxserver containers are known to be using a vulnerable version of log4j (again this applies to the latest version only). This does not mean they are definitely exploitable, but they may be, especially if exposed to the internet:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-davos">Davos&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-booksonic">Booksonic&lt;/a> (Deprecated)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The following Linuxserver containers are unconfirmed as to their vulnerability status, but are Java based and so may be using log4j in some capacity:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-ubooquity">Ubooquity&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

We will continue to update the image until June 2022 at which point it will cease to be supported.
If you are currently running the Unifi Controller image on a 32 bit ARM platform we recommend you look at alternative options such as upgrading to a 64 bit OS if your hardware supports it.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>Due to a lack of upstream support for mongodb on 32 bit platforms, we have made the decision to deprecate our 32 bit ARM (also known as armhf / armv7) Unifi Controller image.
