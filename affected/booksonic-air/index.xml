The last supported tag for 32-bit ARM will be v2201.1.0-ls77.
If you are currently running the Booksonic Air image on a 32-bit ARM platform we recommend you look at alternative options such as upgrading to a 64-bit OS if your hardware supports it.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>Due to the lack of support for modern Java runtime packages on 32-bit ARM from the Alpine repos, we will shortly be deprecating the 32-bit ARM (armhf) version of our &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-booksonic-air">Booksonic Air image&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Multiple vulnerabilities (&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228">CVE-2021-44228&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046">CVE-2021-45046&lt;/a>) have been discovered in log4j which can lead to denial of service and remote code execution.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please note these lists apply to the stated version tags and later &lt;em>only&lt;/em>. If you are running older versions of the images they may still be vulnerable.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-fleet">Fleet&lt;/a> - &lt;code>version-2.3.2&lt;/code> and later (Workaround applied + upstream fix)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-airsonic">Airsonic&lt;/a> (No log4j-core in use)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-habridge">HABridge&lt;/a> (No log4j-core in use)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-unifi-controller">Unifi Controller&lt;/a> - &lt;code>version-6.5.55&lt;/code> and later (Workaround applied + upstream fix)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-booksonic-air/">Booksonic Air&lt;/a> - &lt;code>version-v2112.2.0&lt;/code> and later (Upstream fix)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The following Linuxserver containers have been confirmed not to be affected by CVE-2021-44228 due to existing mitigations, upstream patches, or workarounds applied to the container images, but may still be vulnerable to CVE-2021-45046.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-unifi-controller">Unifi Controller&lt;/a> - &lt;code>version-6.5.54&lt;/code> and later (Workaround applied + upstream fix)&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The following Linuxserver containers are known to be using a vulnerable version of log4j in their current versions and cannot be mitigated by us. This does not mean they are definitely exploitable, but they may be, especially if exposed to the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-booksonic">Booksonic&lt;/a> (Deprecated)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The following Linuxserver containers are unconfirmed as to their vulnerability status, but are Java-based and so may be using log4j in some capacity.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-ubooquity">Ubooquity&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We will update this post as more information becomes available.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>New Container: Booksonic-Air</title><link>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2020-09-15-booksonic-air/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2020-09-15-booksonic-air/</guid><category/><description>We have released a new container for Booksonic-Air!
