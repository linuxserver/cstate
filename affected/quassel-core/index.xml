Quassel-core is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client, meaning that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central core.
This container handles the IRC connection (quasselcore) and requires a desktop client (quasselclient) to be used and configured. It is designed to be always on and will keep your identity present in IRC even when your clients cannot be online.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>We have released a new container for &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-quassel-core">Quassel-Core&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
