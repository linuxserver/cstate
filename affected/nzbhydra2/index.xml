&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please note these lists apply to the stated version tags and later &lt;em>only&lt;/em>. If you are running older versions of the images they may still be vulnerable.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;p>The following Linuxserver containers have been confirmed not to be affected by CVE-2021-44228 due to existing mitigations, upstream patches, or workarounds applied to the container images, but may still be vulnerable to CVE-2021-45046.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The following Linuxserver containers are known to be using a vulnerable version of log4j in their current versions and cannot be mitigated by us. This does not mean they are definitely exploitable, but they may be, especially if exposed to the internet.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-booksonic">Booksonic&lt;/a> (Deprecated)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The following Linuxserver containers are unconfirmed as to their vulnerability status, but are Java-based and so may be using log4j in some capacity.&lt;/p>

Nzbhydra2 is a meta search application for NZB indexers, the &amp;ldquo;spiritual successor&amp;rdquo; to NZBmegasearcH, and an evolution of the original application NZBHydra.
It provides easy access to a number of raw and newznab based indexers. The application NZBHydra 2 is replacing NZBHydra 1 and supports migrating from V1. Be wary that there may be some compatibility issues for those migrating from V1 to V2, so ensure you back up your old configuration before moving over to the new version.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>We have released a new container for &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-nzbhydra2">Nzbhydra2&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
