Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby&amp;rsquo;s 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support. There are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas: just a team who want to build something better and work together to achieve it.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>We have released a new container for &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-jellyfin">Jellyfin&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
