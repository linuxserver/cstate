No user action is required when updating to the new tag, but as ever we recommend ensuring you have a proven backup of your data before performing any updates. Going forward, the :alpine tag will not receive any further updates.
If for some reason you need to remain on the old version, you can pin your install to the version-110.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>As &lt;a href="https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2021-03-10-mariadb-alpine/">previously announced&lt;/a> we have now moved the MariaDB &lt;code>:alpine&lt;/code> tag to &lt;code>:latest&lt;/code> and deprecated our Ubuntu-based image.
