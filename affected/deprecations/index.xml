While these tools are very similar in function, the syntax differs between them.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>qBittorrent Unstable Deprecation Notice</title><link>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2022-01-06-qbittorrent/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2022-01-06-qbittorrent/</guid><category/><description>Due to a lack of upstream support for Ubuntu LTS (Focal), we have made the decision to deprecate our qBittorrent Unstable image.
