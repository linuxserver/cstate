&lt;h2 id="why-taken-from-the-authors-site">Why? (taken from the author&amp;rsquo;s site)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my opinion Calibre is a marvelous tool but is too big and has too much
dependencies to be used for its content server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s the main reason why I coded this OPDS server. I needed a simple
tool to be installed on a small server (Seagate Dockstar in my case).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I initially thought of Calibre2OPDS but as it generate static file no
search was possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later I added an simple HTML catalog that should be usable on my Kobo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So COPS&amp;rsquo;s main advantages are :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No need for many dependencies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No need for a lot of CPU or RAM.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not much code.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search is available.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>With Dropbox / owncloud it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to have an up to date OPDS server.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It was fun to code.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you want to use the OPDS feed don&amp;rsquo;t forget to specify feed.php at the end of your URL.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>New Container: Muximux</title><link>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2016-02-22-muximux/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2016-02-22-muximux/</guid><category/><description>We have released a new container for Muximux!
