The Socket Proxy container is based on this image from Tecnativa and provides a security-enhanced proxy for containers that need to access the Docker Socket on your host.

Given the security-related nature of the container we consider it important that there remains a supported and up to date alternative.</description><content type="html">&lt;p>We have released a new container for &lt;a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-socket-proxy/">Socket Proxy&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
